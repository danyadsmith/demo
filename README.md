# Demo Rails Application

As a new student of Ruby and Rails, I am working through several training resources, including various books and courses. This demo application was created as an exercise from Chapter 2 of the book _Agile Web Development with Rails 4_ published by [The Pragmatic Programmers](https://pragprog.com).

This project demonstrates my process of recording notes and lessons learned in my Git commit messages. The general format of each message includes:

* A one-line description of the change made to the code base

* A link to the exercise (if applicable, typically used for online classes)

* One or more paragraphs describing what I did in this particular commit, recapping Ruby and Rails concepts reviewed in my own words.
